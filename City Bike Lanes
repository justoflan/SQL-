-Created a CTE, found the averag safety rating for each street, listed all streets with an average safety rating of 4 or higher as 'Safe Lane'. 
WITH safety AS (
SELECT street, AVG(safetyrating) AS avgsafetyrating FROM CityBikeLanes
GROUP BY street
ORDER BY avgsafetyrating)

SELECT street, avgsafetyrating, 'Safe Lane' AS tag FROM safety
WHERE avgsafetyrating >=4

-Combined a window function with CASE to label average safety ratings when there was more than one rating for each street. 
SELECT street, safetyrating, AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) AS average_safety_rating, 
CASE 
    WHEN AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY safetyrating) >=4 THEN 'Leave As-is'
    WHEN AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY safetyrating) <=2.5 THEN 'Remove'
    ELSE 'Improvements Needed'
END as recommendations
FROM CityBikeLanes
ORDER BY recommendations
